We classified our data into twelve topics analogous to traditional newspaper sections and investigated whether the spread of information depended upon the Twitter network of followers and followees. To test this, we mapped the social network related to each topic and calculated the occurrence of retweet and mention mes-sages whose senders and receivers were interconnected as followers and followees. We found that on average 10% of retweets (RT-messages) and 5% of direct mentions between users (AT-messages) in Twitter hashtags are sent and received by users interconnected as followers and followees. These figures vary considerably from topic to topic, ranging from 15%-19% within Technology, Special Events and Politics to 3%-5% within the categories Personalities and Twitter-Idioms. The results show that hard-news messages are retweeted by a considerably larger community of users interconnected as followers and followees.

  Abstract                 = {It has been proposed that inferring personal authorship for an event gives rise to intentional binding, a perceptual illusion in which one's action and inferred effect seem closer in time than they otherwise would (Haggard, Clark, \& Kalogeras, 2002). Using a novel, naturalistic paradigm, we conducted two experiments to test this hypothesis and examine the relationship between binding and self-reported authorship. In both experiments, an important authorship indicator - consistency between one's action and a subsequent event - was manipulated, and its effects on binding and self-reported authorship were measured. Results showed that action-event consistency enhanced both binding and self-reported authorship, supporting the hypothesis that binding arises from an inference of authorship. At the same time, evidence for a dissociation emerged, with consistency having a more robust effect on self-reports than on binding. Taken together, these results suggest that binding and self-reports reveal different aspects of the sense of authorship.},

However, it is not always easy for users of social media sites to find people to connect with, decreasing the utility of the network for its users. This position paper looks at different ways we can make friend recommenda- tions, or suggest users to follow on the microblogging site Twitter. We examine a number of ways in which similarity can be defined, and the implications of these differences for community-building. People may want different things for friend suggestions, which has implications for both future research and product design.},

We first introduce the concept of efferent binding: a hypothesized neural process which links representations of intentions to act to representations of the action itself, and finally to representations of the external consequences of action. We then describe two experiments investigating the perceived times of actions and of associated stimulus events. Our results provide evidence for an efferent binding process which influences conscious awareness, and which amounts to a common principle for conscious coding of perception and action.},

Here we used the perceived time of intentional actions and of their sensory consequences as a means to study consciousness of action. These perceived times were attracted together in conscious awareness, so that subjects perceived voluntary movements as occurring later and their sensory consequences as occurring earlier than they actually did. Comparable involuntary movements caused by magnetic brain stimulation reversed this attraction effect. We conclude that the CNS applies a specific neural mechanism to produce intentional binding of actions and their effects in conscious awareness.},

  Abstract                 = {{Social network services have become a viable source of information for users. In Twitter, information deemed important by the community propagates through retweets. Studying the characteristics of such popular messages is important for a number of tasks, such as breaking news detection, personalized message recommendation, viral marketing and others. This paper investigates the problem of predicting the popularity of messages as measured by the number of future retweets and sheds some light on what kinds of factors influence information propagation in Twitter. We formulate the task into a classification problem and study two of its variants by investigating a wide spectrum of features based on the content of the messages, temporal information, metadata of messages and users, as well as structural properties of the users' social graph on a large scale dataset. We show that our method can successfully predict messages which will attract thousands of retweets with good performance.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This paper presents a parse-and-paraphrase paradigm to assess the degrees of sentiment for product reviews. Sentiment identification has been well studied; however, most previous work provides binary polarities only (positive and negative), and the polarity of sentiment is simply reversed when a negation is detected. The extraction of lexical features such as unigram/bigram also complicates the sentiment classification task, as linguistic structure such as implicit long-distance dependency is often disregarded. In this paper, we propose an approach to extracting adverb-adjective-noun phrases based on clause structure obtained by parsing sentences into a hierarchical representation. We also propose a robust general solution for modeling the contribution of adverbials and negation to the score for degree of sentiment. In an application involving extracting aspect-based pros and cons from restaurant reviews, we obtained a 45\% relative improvement in recall through the use of parsing methods, while also improving precision.}},

Using movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques definitively outperform human-produced baselines. However, the three machine learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as on traditional topic-based categorization. We conclude by examining factors that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The goal of sentiment prediction is to automatically identify whether a given piece of text expresses positive or negative opinion towards a topic of interest. One can pose sentiment prediction as a standard text categorization problem. However, gathering labeled data turns out to be a bottleneck in the process of building high quality text classifiers. Fortunately, background knowledge is often available in the form of prior information about the sentiment polarity of words in a lexicon. Moreover, in many applications abundant unlabeled data is also available. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised sentiment prediction algorithm that utilizes lexical prior knowledge in conjunction with unlabeled examples. Our method is based on joint sentiment analysis of documents and words based on a bipartite graph representation of the data. We present an empirical study on a diverse collection of sentiment prediction problems which confirms that our semi-supervised lexical models significantly outperform purely supervised and competing semisupervised techniques.}},

  Abstract                 = {Voluntary actions are thought to be selected with respect to their intended goal. Converging data suggests that medial frontal cortex plays a crucial role in linking actions to their predicted effects. Recent neuroimaging data also suggests that during action selection, the brain pre-activities the representation of the predicted action effect. We review evidence of action effect prediction, both in terms of its neurophysiological basis as well as its functional consequences. By assuming that action preparation includes activation of the predicted sensory consequences of the action, we provide a mechanism to understand sensory attenuation and intentional binding. In this account, sensory attenuation results from more difficult discrimination between the observed action effect and the pre-activation of the predicted effect, as compared to when no (or incorrect) prediction is present. Similarly, a predicted action effect should also reach the threshold of awareness faster (intentional binding), if its perceptual representation is pre-activated. By comparing this potential mechanism to mental imagery and repetition suppression we propose a possible neural basis for the processing of predicted action effects.},

  Abstract                 = {Human actions are often classified as either internally generated, or externally specified in response to environmental cues. These two modes of action selection have distinct neural bases, but few studies investigated how the mode of action selection affects the subjective experience of action. We measured the experience of action using the subjective compression of the interval between actions and their effects, known as temporal binding. Participants performed either a left or a right key press, either in response to a specific cue, or as they freely chose. Moreover, the time of each keypress could either be explicitly cued to occur in one of two designated time intervals, or participants freely chose in which interval to act. Each action was followed by a specific tone. Participants judged the time of their actions or the time of the tone. Temporal binding was found for both internally generated and for stimulus-based actions. However, the amount of binding depended on whether or not both the choice and the timing of action were selected in the same way. Stronger binding was observed when both action choice and action timing were internally generated or externally specified, compared to conditions where the two parameters were selected by different routes. Our result suggests that temporal actioneffect binding depends on how actions are selected. Binding is strongest when actions result from a single mode of selection.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we address the problem of finding authoritative users in a micro-blogging service, Twitter, which is one of the most popular micro-blogging services [1]. Twitter has been gaining a public attention as a new type of information resource, because an enormous number of users transmit diverse information in real time. In particular, authoritative users who frequently submit useful information are considered to play an important role, because useful information is disseminated quickly and widely. To identify authoritative users, it is important to consider actual information flow in Twitter. However, existing approaches only deal with relationships among users. In this paper, we propose TURank (Twitter User Rank), which is an algorithm for evaluating users’ authority scores in Twitter based on link analysis. In TURank, users and tweets are represented in a },
